## 2022 Spring SEA x ENGRSL Python Workshop Series

This repository contains all materials related to the Python workshop series hosted by the **Solar Energy Association (SEA)** and **Engineering Service Learning (ENGRSL)** at the University of California, Merced, in the spring semester of 2022.

These workshops aim to teach the fundamentals of computer programming to participants by using Python as a first language. Workshop participants will work in groups to solve logical puzzles, design algorithms, write code, and finally apply their knowledge to program Tello quadcopter drones.

### Schedule

- March 31 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160
- April 7 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160
- April 14 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160

### Revisions

Compared to the [2021 Fall Series](https://github.com/shawnduong/2021-Fall-SEA-x-ENGRSL-Python-Workshop-Series), the 2022 Spring Series is significantly more adaptive to live happenings and as such, is almost entirely activity-based instead of theory-focused.
