## 2022 Spring SEA x ENGRSL Python Workshop Series

This repository contains all materials related to the Python workshop series hosted by the **Solar Energy Association (SEA)** and **Engineering Service Learning (ENGRSL)** at the University of California, Merced, in the spring semester of 2022.

These workshops aim to teach the fundamentals of computer programming to participants by using Python as a first language. Workshop participants will work in groups to solve logical puzzles, design algorithms, write code, and finally apply their knowledge to program Tello quadcopter drones.

### Schedule

- March 31 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160
- April 7 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160
- April 14 @ 17:30-19:00, SE1 160

### Revisions

Compared to the [2021 Fall Series](https://github.com/shawnduong/2021-Fall-SEA-x-ENGRSL-Python-Workshop-Series), the 2022 Spring Series condenses down event materials to better fit the 90-minute timeslot per event. The 2022 Spring Series also tries to interlace Tello activities between other programming activities in order to make the most use out of the drones and give the drones time to recharge.

The following topics have been removed due to time constraints:
- While loops

The following activities have been removed due to time constraints:
- Number sorting
